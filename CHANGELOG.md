## Features
### Exports
You can now export `Standings`, `Point History` and ` Loot History` to XML and JSON formats for integration with external tools. Check it through `clm export` (or minimap icon if you're a Manager). Be aware that XML export for full database can be very heavy and timeout. This happens due to point history size. If this happens for you (e.g. game freezes and no output is produced) try reloading and limiting the export size. New optimizations coming soon!

### Attendance tracking

Addon tracks now various additional bidder behavior: If they did pass, can't use item, closed window without any action or let the timer expire. You can now get those various informations by hovering over `Info` icon. `PASS` has been removed from main bid display. No action might also mean player has not received bid command (was during reload) or has no or outdated addon installed.

# Classic Loot Manager v1.0.0
**Classic Loot Manager** is now fully complete! Thanks everyone for supporting us through this journey!

## Features
### Time travel mode
Have you ever awarded some DKP only a few days later, to realise it was in error? The thought of fixing it is such a hassle since you did a bunch of other stuff since then (eg, decay) and instead of the audit table looking clean now, it's full of manual corrections? Then this feature is for you!  
With **Time Travel** mode, you can now jump back to a point in time in your audit log and add/remove entries to make corrections / additions in certain point in time! Simply activate time travel through audit GUI and make your changes. They are applied instantly.  
AddOn management is almost fully available during time traveling. Raid management is disabled during time travel.

### Sandbox mode
**Sandbox** mode allows you to place the addon in a state where you are disconnected from others. While disconnected, you are free to do whatever you want without the worry of a change affecting your DKP setup. 
What might this be useful for? Say you bring a new officer into your team and you'd like to assign them the task of managing DKP. With this mode, they can train themselves doing all the normal DKP operations in isolation.  
If you make a set of changes, you can either choose to apply them or discard them once you are done.


# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.1
## Fixes
### ElvUI compatibility
Fix for ElvUI users which, after patch 2.19, handles UI differently, thus resulting in very weird button placements.

# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.0
While this is a backwards compatible fix there is marginal chance to lead to DKP difference when using alt-main linking. Please double check the values when upgrading to this version.

## Features
### Loot Queue
You can now track items that you have looted into the inventory and auction them from a convenient list. Toggle it through `/clm queue`. Tracked loot quality can be changed in configuration.

## Fixes
### Alt-Main linking points fix
When alt-main linking in case of alt missing in roster, when that alt was added to roster, there was an error that did set both main and alts standings to 0 instead of keeping current. **Please double check point values if using alt-main linking when moving to this version.**
### Untrusted window display
Profiles, Raid and Audit window are now read-only accessible to all users through `/clm commands`

### Window location storing
Window location is now properly stored and restored when window is moved to the right side of the screen."}

## Notes
### Event based communication
Auction Manager now uses events to communication. This is a needed step to allow further AddOn / WeakAuras integration.

# Classic Loot Manager v0.12.0
While this is a backwards compatible fix there is marginal chance to lead to DKP difference if profile that had DKP in multiple rosters was removed and then added again. Please double check the values when upgrading to this version.

## Features
Introducing new auditing UI for managers. You can now check every entry created by ledger and restore already ignored entries by ignoring (removing) the original ignore.
## Fixes
### Migration
Migration is now executed with comms disabled and is reversible by wiping entries.
### Hydross DKP award
Hydross DKP boss kill bonus award workaround is now fixed.
### Weekly gains display
Weekly gains are now tracked and displayed even if there is no weekly cap.
### Roster Decay
Roster decay should now use proper, optimised entries.

# Classic Loot Manager v0.11.0
## Features
### Auto-DKP awarding
* On-time bonus - awarded when starting raid
* Raid completion bonus - awarded when ending raid
* Interval bonus - awarded every interval minutes
* Boss kill bonus - configurable per boss and through global value

## Fixes
* `!dkp` without parameters should now return requester standings
* Removed odd alerts when using `!bid` chat command while CLM was enabled (still not recommended).
# Classic Loot Manager v0.10.1
Hotfix version check for lower patch version in bigger minor

# Classic Loot Manager v0.10.0
## Features
### Zero-Sum DKP
CLM now support Zero-Sum DKP. If you aren't aware of how Zero-Sum works, it's a DKP system where, at a rosters inception, an amount of DKP is awarded to each player and from that point onwards, no new DKP is awarded (although addon does not restrict it). When a player spends DKP (loot is awarded), that DKP is awarded evenly to the rest of the roster.

### Chat commands
You can now use the `!bid X` function to bid (even if you don't have CLM installed). It's not recommended though if you have CLM. Values supported include: value / pass / cancel. You can also get information about your standings through `!dkp`. This function needs to be enabled per trusted person.

### Player search
For convenience, you can now search for players by name on the standings screen. This is particularly helpful to those guilds with large rosters.
### Minimum bid increment
You can now configure minimum bid increment to be used in open auction mode.
## Quality of Life
### Smart DKP award
When applying DKP, CLM is now more context aware depending on filter settings. If you are in a raid, DKP will be assigned to raid members. If you aren't, it'll consider the roster, otherwise it will fall back onto the individual player selection. Alternately, selecting a player (or players) in a raid will override this new behaviour.
### Relaxed auctioning
Auctioning is no longer restricted to the master looter. The raid leader can now perform similar functions. Should also allow for bidding from outside of guild raiders.
        

# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.3

1. You will now see an alert when:
  *  Receiving DKP
  *  Item is awarded to you
  *  Your bid is accepted
  *  Your bid is denied
2. Spec sharing will now share proper values from the talen trees.


Classic Loot Manager v0.9.2
===========================

## Fixes
- Fix point miscalculation in some very rare corner cases

Classic Loot Manager v0.9.1
===========================

## Fixes
- Fix point updating issue for some of the users getting Fatal error
- Changelog *do not show* actually works no

Classic Loot Manager v0.9.0
===========================

## Features

### Link your alt to your main character
You can now link an alt character in a roster to your main for the purposes of sharing DKP. For linking to work, characters must exist in the same roster. When you link and alt to a main, the DKP each character currently has is added together. From that point onwards, when one linked character has their DKP changed, the others will also. Loot and point histories are tracked against the alt-linked character they are applied against so in future, if you disconnect a main from an alt, history and point calculations will be retained seperately (and recalculated). To get started, type `/clm link alt main`. You can unlink through `/clm unlink alt`. Removing alt-linked main from a roster will also remove the alt - make sure you unlink before you remove a main! Only trusted players can do that.

### CommunityDKP Migration Support
You can now migrate existing data to CLM. This includes: loot history, point history, and the current DKP standings. Configuration is not migrated. Undertaking a migration should be attempted by a GM with existing data backed up incase of a problem. Best practice is to do it as GM being the only one with CLM installed in the guild. You can trigger one through the command `/clm migrate`. Check out more information on wiki.

### Spec Sharing
Your spec will now be stored and shared numerically in the profile window for others to see.

### Bidding
Base and max buttons are now disabled if the respective limit is set to 0. Your current DKP is now displayed on the bidding window for convenience

### Standings
You can now see information about weekly DKP gains and limits in the standings tooltips."},

### Changelog
There is now ingame changelog 

## Bugfixes
### Raid creation
Fixed an issue where, in the raid window when attempting to create a new raid, if a user didn't re-select the team, CLM would complain.

### Pass on bid
PASS notifciation is now properly being sorted at the end of the list instead of top.

### ElvUI auction from corpse
Now works as expected!
 
## Notes
### WoW DKP Bot integration
[WoW DKP Discord Bot](http://tiny.one/wowdkpbot-discord)Integration is now supported by CLM! To enable it go to Configuration and tick the bot integration box. Experimental. Might have performance impact.

5. Right clicking will no longer unselect selected row in Point / Loot / Raid lists.

New features
------------

1. Per roster hard point cap - maximum DKP points that a player can accumulate at all
2. Weekly point cap - maximum DKP points that a player can get in a weekly reset. The reset day is configurable as either EU or US weekly raid reset day
3. Version control - You can now check what version player is using. This will be refreshed whenever player is online or Raid Ready Check is performed
4. Recovery option to ignore invalid entries - currently this is a GM only command and requires contact with the CLM dev team to execute it properly

Fixes
-----

1. Windows and Icon will now remember their locations when closed
2. Right-clicking on entry in Raid, Point history or Loot history will, in addition to opening menu, select the clicked entry
3. Default value for some tier tokens wasn't properly taken from non-equipable type

Classic Loot Manager v0.5.0 Alpha Milestone
===========================================
This version is backwards incompatible: everyone using version v0.4.x should switch to v0.5.0



MULTIPLE RAID MANAGEMENT
========================
Added multi Raid Management in CLM. This allows creating and managing CLM raids through raid GUI. This functionality is dedicated to trusted players only.

Basic concepts:
Player can only be part of a single raid.
1) Trusted players create raid through raid manager. This corelates the raid with a roster during creation and allows raid naiming for readability. By default each raid uses settings provided by the roster but they can be changed on per-raid basis (not all options are enabled at this point). When creating a CLM raid, player becomes part of that raid.

2) When in ingame raid, one of the trusted players becomes Raid Owner. Raid Owner is a trusted person that is Master Looter in master loot mode or Raid Leader else.

3) Raid Owner should start the raid when the group is ready. All players in current ingame raid will be added to the CLM raid. When enabled On-Time bonus will be applied on start (functionality not yet implemented) Additionaly at this moment auctioning becomes available to Raid Owner and loot awards will be related to this raid. All Roster changes will be handled automatically by Raid Owner.

4) At the end Raid Owner should End the raid. This will lock the raid as finished and assign any End bonusses (functionality not yet implemented).


It is imperative that there is a trusted person in raid that is the Raid Owner (ML/RL) for the addon to function properly.

In case there will be no trusted peron in an ingame raid (disconnect, quit etc) there is an option for trusted person to joina CLM raid. After becoming ML/RL (Raid Owner) that person will be handling all the funcionalities.

GUI was reworked to incorporate the changes.



AWARD WITHOUT AUCTION
=====================
Added slash command to award items without auctioning with the syntax:
1) Award linked item to player in named roster for value:
   /clm award Item Link/Value/Roster/Player
   Example: /clm award [Hearthstone]/15/Mighty Geese/Bluntlighter

2) Award linked item to currently targeted player in named roster for value:
   /clm award Item Link/Value/Roster
   Example: /clm award [Hearthstone]/15/Mighty Geese

3) While being in active raid award linked item to targeted player for value:
   /clm award Item Link/Value
   Example: /clm award [Hearthstone]/15

4) While being in active raid award linked item to targeted player for 0:
   /clm award Item Link
   Example: /clm award [Hearthstone]
